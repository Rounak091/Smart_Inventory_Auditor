# TODO: Enhance Frontend for Modern Look with Animations and Effects

## Approved Plan Breakdown
1. **Restructure HTML**: Update HTML structure with semantic elements (header, main, footer) and a container for centering content.
2. **Add Modern CSS Styling**: Embed CSS for modern fonts (Google Fonts), color scheme, responsive design using flexbox, shadows, and rounded corners.
3. **Implement Animations and Transitions**: Add fade-in animation on page load, smooth transitions for form elements, and hover effects on buttons (scale and color change).
4. **Add Visual Enhancements**: Include loading spinner for submit action, icons, and ensure accessibility with proper labels and focus states.
5. **Update JavaScript**: Modify JS to handle loading state and integrate with animations.
6. **Test and Verify**: Open the page in a browser to check animations, responsiveness, and full functionality with backend.
